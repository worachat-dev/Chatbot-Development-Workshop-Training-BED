# Chatbot Development Workshop

## Building a Simple Chatbot from Scratch in Python (using NLTK)

### Instructor: Worachat Wannawong, Ph.D. 2024

This repository contains the code and instructions for building a simple chatbot using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). The chatbot can respond to basic greetings and questions.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
    ```sh
    pip install nltk
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the provided Jupyter notebook in Google Colab or your local Jupyter environment.
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially to set up and start the chatbot.
3. Type your questions or greetings to interact with the chatbot. Type 'quit' to end the conversation.

## Code Explanation

### Import Libraries

```python
from nltk.chat.util import Chat, reflections
```
We import the necessary libraries from NLTK. The `Chat` class is used to create the chatbot, and `reflections` is a dictionary that helps the chatbot to understand and respond to the user inputs better.

### Define Reflections

```python
print("Reflections dictionary:")
print(reflections)
```
We print the `reflections` dictionary to see the predefined mappings of user inputs to chatbot responses.

### Define Pairs

```python
pairs = [
    ['Hello', ['Hi! How can I help you?']],
    ['Need help', ['How can I help you?']],
    ['I am Worachat', ['Nice to hear that']],
    ['What is your name?', ['I am Chatbot and here to help you']],
    ['What is Chatbot?', ['Chatbot is a python program to help you']]
]
```
We define a list of pairs where each pair consists of a pattern and a list of possible responses. The chatbot will use these patterns and responses to interact with the user.

### Create and Start the Chatbot

```python
chat = Chat(pairs, reflections)
print("Type 'quit' to end the conversation.")
chat.converse()
```
We create a `Chat` object with the defined pairs and reflections and start the conversation. The chatbot will keep conversing with the user until the user types 'quit'.
